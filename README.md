## Getting started
Simply place a chest, put some items of the same type in it, and /setprice. Tada! You now have a shop!

Left-click a shop to view item details (hover over text in chat), and then /buy as much as you want.

Revenues from sales are transferred to the player when they open the chest.

## Commands
- /shop - Tells you how to setup a shop. Configurable.
- /setprice - Sets the price per item of a shop
- /buy - Buys items from the selected shop

## Features
- Supports DoubleChests! (Wasn't a simple task.)
- All shop data (prices and revenue) is stored in the world! No messy, potentially-corruptible storage files!
- Supports custom items. Displays custom item name and lore.
- Uses Minecraft item names if you're using [Paper](https://papermc.io)
- Supports all region protection plugins! No need to "allow use" or anything silly like that just to allow players to buy.
- Uses your economy's format and symbol! Fancy
- Nearly every message is configurable.
- Chests named "shop" (or whatever you have set in the config) will help prompt players to create a shop with that chest. Useful if you "sell" shops to players.
